# Uber Data Analytics and LLM-companion

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset from a ride-sharing service to understand and mitigate a high ride cancellation rate. By examining the underlying reasons for cancellations, the project seeks to provide a data-driven solution that can improve operational efficiency, increase revenue, and enhance the experience for both drivers and riders.

## The Problem

A preliminary analysis of ride-sharing data revealed a significant challenge: a 25% ride cancellation rate. This high number represents a substantial loss in potential revenue and indicates friction for all users on the platform. The data shows that most cancellations are initiated by customers, pointing to a critical area for investigation and improvement.

The core question this project seeks to answer is: "Why are so many rides being canceled?"

## The Solution: Project Deliverables

This project isn't just a report; it's a suite of tools designed to provide continuous value. The main deliverables include:

### An Interactive Dashboard

A visual tool for stakeholders to monitor key metrics, track cancellation trends, and gain a quick understanding of the operational health of the ride-sharing service

### An AI Companion

A natural language interface that allows non-technical users to get instant, factual insights from the data by simply asking questions

### An Automated Data Pipeline

A system that ensures the data and the insights derived from it are always up-to-date, transforming this from a one-time analysis into a production-ready solution

## The Technical Stack

The project's architecture is built using a combination of data storage, processing, and visualization tools. It is designed to be cost-effective and scalable, leveraging a generous free tier to demonstrate an understanding of resource management and cloud economics.
