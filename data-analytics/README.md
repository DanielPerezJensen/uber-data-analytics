# Data Pre-Processing & Analytics

## Deliverables

The deliverables of this sub-module are three-fold:

### An Automated Data Pipeline

A system that ensures the data and the insights derived from it are always up-to-date, transforming this from a one-time analysis into a production-ready solution.

### An Interactive Dashboard

A visual tool for stakeholders to monitor key metrics, track cancellation trends, and gain a quick understanding of the operational health of the ride-sharing service

### Pre-processed data useful for the LLM Companion

The LLM companion will be a natural language interface that allows non-technical users to get instant, factual insights from the data by simply asking questions. We must prepare the data to be useful for this purpose.
